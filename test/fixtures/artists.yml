        Symphony","url_slug":"10-string-symphony","description":"The Nashville music
        scene is a famous home for world-class side musicians, as well as a plethora
        of legendary songwriters.  Now it presents us with a duo that combines the
        best of both worlds, skilled instrumentalists with an incredible amount of
        soul and a love of great songs.\r\n\r\n10 String Symphony is an arena for
        mesmerizing acoustic innovation.  Although difficult to categorize, their
        music is instantly recognizable as a blend of two distinct but equally vivacious
        musical voices, encompassing \u201caggressive, almost discordant, celtic and
        dare I say punky string-chording experimentations\u201d (The Bluegrass Situation).  Vocally,
        Rachel Baiman and Christian Sedelmyer lock in seamlessly, and their vocal
        duets often take center stage despite the fact that they are self-described
        fiddle players.\r\n\r\nSedelmyer (Formerly of the Farewell Drifters) and Baiman
        (Formerly of Belfry Fellows) met in Nashville, and realized a mutual love
        for the range and depth of the 5-String fiddle.  Their desire to see just
        how far a two-fiddle, two-vocals instrumentation could take them was the inspiration
        for the 10 String Symphony project.  By the time their first full-length album
        was released in November 2012, their instrumentation had expanded to include
        the occasional clawhammer banjo and resonator mandolin, though still maintaining
        a stripped down, tightly woven and carefully arranged duo sound.\r\n\r\nDecidedly
        contemporary in their musical approach, their debut album showcases Sedelmyer\u2019s
        virtuosic improvisation and creative harmonic soundscape ideas alongside Baiman\u2019s
        old-time rhythm and emotional melodic sensibilities. Just over a year old,
        the duo has already gained recognition and attention from some major festivals,
        landing slots at the ROMP festival in Ownsboro, KY and the Strawberry Music
        Festival in Yosemite, CA in the summer of 2013.","url":"http:\/\/www.eventfinda.co.nz\/artist\/10-string-symphony","web_sites":{"@attributes":{"count":0},"web_sites":[]},"images":{"@attributes":{"count":1},"images":[{"id":451715,"is_primary":true,"transforms":{"@attributes":{"count":5},"transforms":[{"transformation_id":2,"url":"http:\/\/cdn.eventfinda.co.nz\/uploads\/artists\/transformed\/451715-1218-2.jpg","width":80,"height":53},{"transformation_id":15,"url":"http:\/\/cdn.eventfinda.co.nz\/uploads\/artists\/transformed\/451715-1218-15.jpg","width":75,"height":75},{"transformation_id":8,"url":"http:\/\/cdn.eventfinda.co.nz\/uploads\/artists\/transformed\/451715-1218-8.jpg","width":190,"height":127},{"transformation_id":27,"url":"http:\/\/cdn.eventfinda.co.nz\/uploads\/artists\/transformed\/451715-1218-27.jpg","width":350,"height":350},{"transformation_id":7,"url":"http:\/\/cdn.eventfinda.co.nz\/uploads\/artists\/transformed\/451715-1218-7.jpg?v=2","width":650,"height":280}]}}]},"location":{"id":822,"name":"United
